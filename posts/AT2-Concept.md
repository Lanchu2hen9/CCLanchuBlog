# General Notes:

Tom I am very excited for this new unit. LET'S GOOOOOOO!

## Ideas:

- [Recursion](https://blog.science.family/240321_recursion)

I want to do smth like this [turquiose & hot pink water droplet.](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders#adding-interactions) or smth like this [Concentric Circles](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders#1-concentric-circles), where user interactions creates disturbance and or chaos. Not this [Radial vs Linear Patterns](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders#3-radial-vs-linear-patterns), because I want to do smth with a fractual tree, and using this shader will be too chaotic.
