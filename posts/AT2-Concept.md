# General Notes:

Tom I am very excited for this new unit. LET'S GOOOOOOO! [^1]

## Ideas:

- [Recursion](https://blog.science.family/240321_recursion)

I want to do smth like this [turquiose & hot pink water droplet.](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders#adding-interactions) or smth like this [Concentric Circles](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders#1-concentric-circles), where user interactions creates disturbance and or chaos. Not this [Radial vs Linear Patterns](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders#3-radial-vs-linear-patterns), because I want to do smth with a fractual tree, and using this shader will be too chaotic.

# Requirements:

- Must use either: "fractal, moire, glitch, and 3D techniques."
- Responds to one of the following essays:
  1. Information & Thinking by Michel Serres
  2. What Is It Like to Be A Fungus? by Merlin Sheldrake
  3. Xenofemenism: A Politics for Alienation by Laboria Cuboniks

# A Response to Information & Thinking by Michel Serres:

Serres states that everything "emits information, receives it, stores it and processes it", and that humans are not unique in the Universe because by their definition Rocks, trees, fungi, machines, and stars all “think”.

A counter-argument to the Serres' rejection of the anthropocentrism ideal. Is that humans although not special in the grand scheme of things, they are sapient. This sapience makes us special in a weird way. I would break down sapience into 2 categories; which I would define as "Sapience" (Human-like sapience), and "Proto-sapience" animal-like sapience.

Also ChatGPT defines sapience as:

> "Refers to beings with advanced intellectual abilities: abstract reasoning, judgment, self-reflection, planning."

I define sapience as:

> "If you have enough of a conscious/'abstract reasoning/judgement' to do evil or in a less eloquent term; 'Fuck around and find out.' Or you have a central nervous systems, you are sapient."

So humans are in the Human-like sapience. And animals like; pigs[^2], dolphins, elephants, great apes, crows, parrots, are in the animal-like sapience. Any everything else in the animal kingdom are like in the sentient & concious category.

# How does this relate to AT2?

The concept that I want to tackle is "Processing ≠ Thinking", just because you process something doesn't mean you understand it. "Hearing ≠ listening."

- I want to create something that when the user interacts with that thing it responds "human-like", now my brain is like: "How about you create smth like a LLM?" I said no cus I have 2 weeks to code this thing.
- So I might use an array and maybe an area in which the user can drop down "responses" to the code and the code respones using pre-determined information.
- Since drop-down menus are painful to code, and I do not have enough determination in week 7, I might just use smth like "IfMouseIsPressed".

- I still want to use recursion, so maybe on user input recursion happens.
- This [turquiose & hot pink water droplet.](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders#adding-interactions) but I want the water droplet to distort some kind of noise/perlin noise background. And on user click it creates either fractual trees, and or more distortions.

Smth like this: [P5.js - Creating a 2D starfield using P5.js | Starry Night Background](https://youtu.be/xbmwfg5U9-s?si=zOxnLPkHqoLTwaEx) But the stars "zoom in" on the user mouse click.

[^1]: Update its the 17th April 2025 Lanchu here, I am very tired. The sem broke me, before I broke it.
[^2]: A pig would eat a human if given the chance. And dolphins have pretty privilege.
