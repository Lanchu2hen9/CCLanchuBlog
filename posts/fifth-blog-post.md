# Task 1:

**Kindred Spirit:** Waves  
**Context:**  
So the context of the Kindred Spirit "waves" is the organic and organised moving rhythm of the oscillating waves as shown in [this](https://youtu.be/nqvJDkKsYYI?si=o4m5xbUzHIWzzB91). Personally, speaking I like on a conceptual level, I like how waves can be calming and yet turbulent the impermance ever-changing nature[^1] of waves. And if we're talking about my own affinity/kinship for it, it would be the fact that I relate to the ever-changing nature of waves, and I feel that my identity as changed a lot, (in the 2+ years of this degree), similar to how waves are ever-changing. And the ducks are there, because quote on quote the assignment brief says:

> "cute aesthetic in the visual, sonic, and interactive domains."

What's more cuter then a duck xylophone that mimics those playground/xylophone children play with?

**Purpose:**
To create a cute, aesthetically pleasing and wave simulation, whose visuals, sounds and interactions come together to create a playful, "cute"[^2] and calming experience for the user.

**Challenge/Adversary:**
Our shared challenge is finding structure in the everyday chaos of daily life. As woman in her twenties, which is a period of time often marked as a liminal transitional period, where you're techinically an adult legally speaking, but you're still figuring out wtf you should do with your life. Waves for me represent a calming force in this transitional period of my life.

# Task 2:

**Please expand on your discussions from homework: 2a to explain how your chosen kindred spirit may understand or relate to the visual, sonic, and interactive elements of your AT1 idea. Please use embedded p5 sketches to help explain your ideas.**  
Honestly for the sonic part, I might just use ambient background pond/waves sounds. That or I am not going to use that much sounds at all for the background.

# Task 3:

[^1]: Artistic Yapping at its finest Tom. I hope you appreciate my blog and footnotes.
[^2]: As in both fun to play with and cute to look at. "Cute" is the definition of easily commercialised, and commodified.
