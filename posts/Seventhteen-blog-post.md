# Task 1:

Here's the video for task 1:

<iframe 
    id="strudel" 
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBIFgN9v0LI"
    title="YouTube video player" 
    frameborder="0" 
    width="100%"
    height="400"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

<script type="module">
    const iframe = document.getElementById('strudel')
    const updateDimensions = () => {
        iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
        iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16
    }
    
    updateDimensions()
    window.addEventListener('resize', updateDimensions)
</script>

# Task 2:

If I am going to be real with you there is no specific thing that I found the most interesting. The most specificially interesting thing/fun thing to do within the above video is experiementing on the fly with different instruments within flok.cc.

# Live Coding Community:

## Domain:

Well I guess things are **live** so, the community's shared interest would be any performative, abstract that allows performers to combine, experiement, and perform visuals and sound through algorithms. Their shared interest would be any "library" and or online shared resource that allows people to learn/pick up code on their own.

## Repertoire:

### Tools:

- Strudel.cc
- Hydra
- Flok.cc
- FoxDot / TidalCycles / Sonic Pi
- OBS, VJ tools, Projection Mapping Software

### Languages:

- Syntax tailor specifically to the coding "platform".
- short, Time-orientated words.

### Workflows:

- Live looping and raw code in front of ppl.
- Collaborative coding sessions with other ppl.

## Values:

I guess the community values collaborative coding jam sessions, where errors, flaws are transparent to the audience and listeners. I guess this community is very collabrative with each other.

# Task 2; discussion question:

**How does live coding (as a form of music, art, and performance) affect why young people want to learn, how they're taught, what people talk about, and what laws might be relevant?**

## How it may affect young people?

I guess completely from an outsider's prespective coding in-general feels like a very inaccessible form of technology. Personally, I feel like most people are very daunted by the fancy technical terms of coding. With the event of live coding, and the Internet/online spaces. I feel like this makes "coding" as a whole more digestible and "market-able" to a certain extent to the general public.

And also due to the transparency of the live coding community, people see "coding" less of an incomprehensible black box and more of something that is achieve-able.
