# Task 1:

From my understanding [WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) API is literally just Zoom but with websites and using servers not connected to the main wifi/firewall & [The WebSocket API (WebSockets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), is the message/"chat-room" equvilent of WebRTC.

There's the ASCII typing board website thing, where one website vistor types something onto the website and what they've typed is like a message that they've left behind. The website is also like a scrollable map thingy like miroboard, where you can click and drag to see other messages on the canvas that other vistors has left behind.

- [Scream Into the void](https://screamintothevoid.com/)

Maybe something like a open book where when some visits the website and types/clicks smth it leaves a trail of effects or messages behind for the next user to see.

## Idea 1:

**This will done via "WebSockets API"**
I want to create a website that looks like a digital year book. When the user/my friends first opens the "digital year book" they are greeted with a screen with different "profile picture avatars" that they can choose to represent themselves the most. Once a "profile picture avatar" is chosen from that screen. That "profile picture avatar" is taken and put into a design of a year book in which I will create.

### For the quotes page:

User1 would be able to log onto with another user, say User2. Both User1 and User2 Would have their chosen "profile picture avatar" put into the photo part of the year book quotes section. And as each of the user types, the "quotes text" box will highlight, and it will be like they're communicating through the year book.

### Standard Year book page:

This would be designed like a standard yearbook page, but instead of the depicting people in the pictures show in yearbooks, it would depict the options/animals I give as the "profile picture avatars". At the start screen.

For example, with one page I plan to have a quotes page, but instead of the "student's image" its just cute stylised images of the "profile picture avatars" on the start screen.

Headings, text and things will be interactable on this page. For example when a user clicks on the heading on this page, the heading will collapse, sending all the elements into an anti-gravity mode like in [this example](https://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-gravity/).

## Idea 2:

**This will be done via WebRTC API.**  
Will take the form of a standard video call website where 2 users will be able to connect regardless of what device they are on. But the buttons will do funny/fun things when the user try to click on it.

### Fun Interactions:

When either user clicks/taps on the mute button it will run away from the user's mouse or try to escape from the user's finger on mobile _(not exactly sure how this will work on touchscreen devices, but it doesn't have to work on touchscreen devices.)_ You will have to catch the mute button in order to mute yourself.

When the camera off button is pressed the camera will briefly turn off then on and then their faces will be pixelated like they're in some anonymous documentary thing/witness protection. (Glitch is optional here.)

Leave button just closes the website like exiting out a call. I'm not adding more stuff for me to code.

And the share screen button allows you to draw things on the screen.

## A.I. Prompt:

I want o
