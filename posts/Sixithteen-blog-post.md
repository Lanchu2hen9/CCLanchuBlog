# Task 2:

**List 5 communities of practice (CoPs) you are a member of, including the domain, repertoire, and values of said community.**

1. Domain (shared area of interest or focus)
2. Repertoire (shared tools, language, practices, resources)
3. Values (shared beliefs and principles guiding the community)

## UX/UI Community:

So I have signed up for an UX volunteer before. I haven't done much in the volunteer community, its there I exist in it. There's also the UX/UI class from last year. And I could get into contact with fellow classmates who are interested in UX/UI design if necessary for this AT2. If possible I can try to find more online community about UX/UI? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Domain:

UX/UI design. Depending on which side of the community you are on, it can focus on UX over UI design more. So basically their domain is creating intuitive, visually appealing and simple web, app experiences for the user.

### Repertoire:

#### Tools:

If the designer is more focused on the "research/prototyping" side of UX/UI design, its usually the following tools:

- Figma
- Adobe XD
- Framer (more website designy)
- Lyssna (A user testing website)
- Optimal Workshop (UX research platform)
- A good old google forms or google docs for interviewing and surveys.

If the members of the community come from a more _"visual designy/Graphic Designy"_ background/i.e. they focus more on designing visually appealing and efficent interfaces, their tools will be:

- Adobe Indesign.
- Illustrator
- Photoshop.

#### Methods:

Methods the way in which this specific community go about doing what they do. The list of methods are as follows:

- User Journey Mapping.
- Usability Tests:
  - First Click tests.
  - 5 second tests
  - Walkthrough tests.
  - Pape prototyping.
- Interviewing the community before hand.
- Wireframes.
- Mockups
- Heuristic Evaluation

#### Language:

- MircoInteraction
- Call-to-action (CTA)
- User Persona.
- Empathy.
- Affordances.
- Information architechure

#### Cultural Norms & Workflows:

- Collaborating on Figma
- Testing prototype early.
- Designing Accessibile protoypes.
- Using design systems.

### Values:

Finding a problem within a community, understanding the reason, and actors and mechanics behind why the reason happens. Also empathising with the people within this community who has the said problem. I personally feel like with UX/UI design its understanding the people within a certain community and how they interact with a system at large.

And also with the UI part of UX/UI design I feel like a lot of modern designers, value flat design/that minimalistic design aesthetic over more complicated like skeuomorphism. Although there probably are exceptions to this.

## Front-end Community:

This sort of overlaps with the creative coding community, because a lot of Javascript is front-end, along with HTML and CSS. I'm not as involved in this community. But its there nevertheless.

### Domain:

Pretty much anything with the front-end, like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Repertoire:

#### Languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Copilot says that for CSS:
  - **SASS/SCSS:** A CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to make styling more efficient.
  - **LESS:** Another CSS preprocessor similar to SASS.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling by using predefined classes.
- Copilot says for Javascript:
  - **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making code more robust and easier to debug.
  - **CoffeeScript:** A language that compiles into JavaScript, offering a cleaner syntax.
- Copilot says for HTML:
  - **Pug (formerly Jade):** A templating engine that simplifies HTML syntax and allows for reusable components
  - **Handlebars:** A templating language for creating dynamic HTML content.

**Design Systems & UI Libraries:** Tailwind, Material UI, Bootstrap.

#### Tools:

- VSCode
- Git & Github
- package managers (npm, pnpm).

#### Resources:

- [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

#### Practices:

- Branching
- Semantic markup such s `<h1></h1>` tags and alt text in html.
- Readable indented code for other coders to read.

### Values:

Reable, and Accessible code and user interfaces for everyone to read. Open source, coding resources for people to be able to learn and teach themselves how to code. An open colabrative space for ppl to create, learn from each other.

And also ChatGPT states about the values:

> "Maintainability: Write code that‚Äôs readable, reusable, and scalable."

## Creative Coding Community:

**And then list the domain, repertoire, and values of creative coding.**

### Domain:

The shared area of interest for Creative Coding, would using Javascript (and probably other coding languages), as an artistic often abstract, experimental, or interactive way of expressing your opinions, thoughts and or ideas. Creative coding domains are often in the form of:

- Installations
- Random generative noise
- Sound Installations.

### Repertoire:

#### Tools/Resources:

- Three.js
- RiTa.js
- Web Audio API
- p5.js
- q5.js

### Values:

The creative coding community values playfulness, experiementation, the mixing of media from different disciplines. Open-source resources, spaces online and offline for both those who are just starting out in code, and also those who are masters of code.
