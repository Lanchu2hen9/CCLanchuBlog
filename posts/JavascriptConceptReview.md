# General Math/Maths scripting Language:

- 7 \*\* 2 is "7 to the power of 2."
- When doing the following:
  > function setup () {  
  >  const NotEqual = 7 _ 7 == 5 _ 5
  > console.log(NotEqual);
  > }
  - The console should print out false, I assume this is because the computer does the little mathy mathy, and gives out a false statement.
  - Same goes for print ();
- Remember that "${...}", allows you to do the following:
  - Insert strings
  - Do maths
  - Call functions
  - Call information stored within previously established variables.
  - Straight up use an array.
  - ~Manspreads~ Splays content over multiple lines of code.
- "FrameCount();" Pretty self-explaintory, it counts deez framez.

# General Notes:

- Don't use print ();, use console.log(``);
  - Because useing print (); outside of the setup () {} function actually prints out things.

# Colours:

- **Paradigms:** fancy ass for different colour modes. There are two modes:
  - Your RGB mode. (Default)
  - HSB mode.
- **Color objects:** You can store "color(...);" within variables and extract the red, green and blue channels of said stored variable.

# Iteration:

- The while loop code is below, be careful, running conditional logic can lock up your browser.
- See ["for" loops](https://cclanchublo6.deno.dev/second-blog-post)
