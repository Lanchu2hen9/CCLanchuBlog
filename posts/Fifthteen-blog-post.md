# Task 1:

What do you think McKenzie Wark means, when she states that:

> "Unlike the interesting, the zany really works against its constraints."

So to answer that question we must first define what Wark defines are the "Interesting" and the "Zany".

The Interesting ~ it is the mild intellectual stimulation and or absorption of the process behind the creation of the artwork. Its the idea of how much or how little information is thrown at the viewer for them to digest.

The Zany ~ it is all about the **_intentional_** crazed playfulness of an artwork. In a more satirical light, its the intentional mocking mimicry of a subject matter. So if we put it in a less eloquent term, its basically stares in the face of helplessness and goes: "Fuck it we ball."[^1] The Zany aesthetic also doesn't take itself quite seriously.

**In what ways would you consider the chaotic and the zany to be similar? In what ways are they different?**
"Chaotic"/chaos has no choice, while the "Zany" is waking up one day, and realising that you have free will, and choosing to do something extremely absurd. While chaotic and the zany both have a level of absurdism and randomness to it, Chaos has no free will, the "Zany" does. [^2]

**In what ways would you consider your AT2 to be zany?**  
If we're going off my previous definition of the "Zany", I didn't read the Florian Cramer article on the Post-digital, I have free will and I chose not to read that specific article. And made something random and chaotic.

**What might be some ways to make your AT2 more zany?**  
I have no clue.

# Task 2:

I'll probably be writing the response to task to Task 2 [here](https://cclanchublo6.deno.dev/AT2-Final#week-7-homework-7b-task-2-questions).  
[Top ⬆︎](#)

[^1]: "Fuck it we ball" is a phrase that means "to go headfirst into something with full commitment regardless of possible consequences."
[^2]: On a side note you can philosophical and ethical about whether or not humans have free will, there's a whole ass branch of pyschology dedicated to this.
