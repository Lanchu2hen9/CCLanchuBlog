# Task 1:

![C# script](Homework10b.png)

**Why you are interested in this scripting language?**  
If I am going to be frank, I'm not the most interested for this scripting language. My exploration of the OneComplier partially stems from the fact that I can't be bothered to re-download Unity and choose to do the "Scripting in Unity" task. Unity is 5~30 GB and may lag your computer depending on how well your computer runs, its not that my laptop can't handle Unity, its just that I don't want to sit there and wait 30+ mins for Unity to install.

Other that the wait time, I was interested in OneComplier because it is written in C# and I've done some very basic "A.I. assisted" programming in Unity C# script before.

**how you might use this scripting language in your own creative practice.**
Complied languages are painful as hell, I have the deepest respect to those who have the passion and patience to use complied languages. In terms of creative practise, I originally started out my web design/developement stuff in Unity and game stuff. I might go back to it 30 years later, if the industry calls for complied languages or I might pick it up as a hobby or something.

# OneComplier/ C#:

## Strengths:

- Specifically specified variable types, and easier to debug errors.
- Versatile works on literally on any device.
- A lot of people use C#, so there's more support in terms of software.
- Widely used in the development industry, its the "industry standard."[^1]

## Weaknesses:

- Require Compiling.
- Syntax errors/console errors are your worse enemy. (Its quite difficult to learn.)
- Requires .NET (i.e the complier).
- Closely tied to Mircosoft.

# Javascript:

## Strengths:

- Asynchronous Programming (Javasript can do multiple tasks at a time.)
- Light weight.
- _Flexible_: Doesn't get triggered at you if you slightly mess up the type definition/syntax.

## Weaknesses:

- Web-specific.
- Bit quirky, sometimes assigning variables and values to variables are a bit off in Javascript.

# Complied Languages VS interpreted language:

## Complied Strength VS Interpreted Strengths:

| Complied Strengths                    | Interpreted Strengths                               |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| - More Industry Used                  | - More flexible                                     |
| - Versatile                           | - Easy to use for rapid prototyping, and debugging. |
| - Fast Execution                      | - Easy to learn/less steep of a learning curve.     |
| - Catches errors prior to runtime.    | - Instant feedback.                                 |
| - Better security.                    | - More beginner friendly community/resources.       |
| - More control over memory management |                                                     |

## Complied Weaknesses VS Interpreted Weaknesses:

| Complied Weaknesses                                            | Interpreted Weakneses                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Learning Curve is steeper.                                   | - Relies more heavily on "third party" web APIs.               |
| - Slower Development Cycle, must be complied before "testing". | - Code might run slower cus its complied as the code is "ran'. |
| Requires more setup.                                           | - Exposed source code = less secure.                           |
