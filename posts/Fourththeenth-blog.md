# Task 1:

**How will you make the sound design for your AT2 function in a chaotic aesthetic register?**

**What does it mean to be chaotic in the sonic domain? In your discussion, please make reference effective complexity, paying particular attention to the following:**
**1. Structure - what structures our perception of sound?**
In terms of structure humans are pattern recognition machines, humans in terms of both scientific understanding and art in general seek to find patterns, musical motifs, tempos, beats and structure. Pure chaos in this section is to have a lack of recongisable structure by the human ear.

**2. Noise - what differentiates noise from sound, or music?**
Music is when order is injected into chaos. The line between chaos music is those really experimental sound stuff. Like Merzbow or free jazz[^1]. Where there's an inherent randomness to the sound/music as obviously produced by the musician.

**3. Voice - what makes voice a separate category of sound?**
Voice is when information, and structure is injected into noise/a sound. When mixed with the other two categories, Voice brings an inherent randomness to sound.

In yapping about Sound and every, I would like to say I am not a sound person in general, I dislike loud sounds, and anything that's not either white noise or black noise distracts me. But for AT2, I am legally obligated to use sound, so I will use sound. I'll probably do something simple, get two arrays, one for the x-axis and the other for the y-axis. Plot it so that when the random two audio from space is played based on the user's x and y axis positions. Randomness cus chaos.
