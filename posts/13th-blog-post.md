# Task 1:

**Work out how to do screen recording on your computer.**  
`Shift` + `‚åò Cmd` + `5` my dude, I don't have anything fancy like Obs. Also the default screen recording is probably going to drain my battery a lot during the actual recording recording. ü™´ => My battery during the recording as well as my energy rn.

# Task 2:

# Task 4:

I'm going to be real with you Tom if you do read this, which you probably are doing to do so, or so some else is doing so. Because someone is watching the Youtube videos embedded into my blog. I've heard "community of practise" & "industry practise" numerous times this semester, and well despite the fact that a "community"/"target audience" is very important in both a commerical industry sense and as a creative. But at the end of the day I have to get this assignment done and out of the way since there is a deadline.

> "it‚Äôs always the ticking clock that ignites the real momentum." -Ana Vicol

I would love to do more fun with creative coding in AT3, but its week 12, and I've other things to do. And everything is a ticking clock, including my lifespan. Practicality first, Tom, practicality first. ü´©üëçüèª

## My Plan:

1. Get WebRTC set up first. The go from there.
2. Finish all the code.
3. Playtest WebRTC with classmates, and see if WebRTC actually works.
4. If it does work message friends and get them to explore the WebRTC website while I record them.
5. Because at the end of the day my WebRTC thing is on the user end and all the pixelate/button should technically work on their end. So I'll just send the link to them.
6. Write out my blog posts, because at the end of the day I have to finish this assignment and I have other things that I have to do in my life.
7. Submit assignment deliverables, and go to sleep. **#MostImportantStep**

## Legally Obligated Community of Practise

### Domain (shared area of interest or focus):

Studying over call, because we're all university students and either suck at studying on our own. Our studying issues range from poor-impluse control to low-motivation.[^1] So on the rare occasion when everyone is available on instagram to "study & call" we body-double over call and hold each other accountable.

### What is Body doubling?

This is from A.I. overview in Google btw.

**Body Doubling;** This involves having another person present while you work, either physically or virtually. The presence of the other person can help create a sense of accountability and provide a structured environment that improves concentration and productivity.

**Virtual Body Doubling;** This is a variation of body doubling where the "doubles" are present virtually, often through a video call. This allows for the same benefits of accountability and focus without being physically present.

### Repertoire:

Mute btn - Both personally and physically speaking I can't really "lock-in"[^2] intensely for study if there's loud noises in the room. This includes the sound of my friend's dog barking over the call, so there's an "unspoken" (not unspoken) rule that if you want to "lock in fuck in" you mute yourself. Would you call this a behaviour Tom?

### Values:

Productivity, considering me and my friend group we're not the most neurotypical of friend groups. I also like parallel play with my friends over call. Like they could be doing the most random thing like making dinner or smth, I would just exist next to them.

# How are you going to use the code?

WebRTC to link my friends together, in relation to the body doubling and parallel play thing. Run away button and camera off button because I think its a fun, novelty thing for them to play with in week 12 where everyone is that University grindset mindset. And hopefully if the WebRTC connection works, I should be able to record their reactions on my end.

# Task 5:

## The Deadline's Call

By Gemini.

The clock's hand spins around,  
A deadline looms, a final push,  
No time for idle dreams.

Yet, in this hurried pace,  
A "community of practice"  
Forms, a common goal.

Friends on silent calls,  
Body doubling, finding focus,  
Through shared screen, we thrive.

WebRTC links,  
A digital shared space,  
Novelty and fun.

Practicality reigns,  
Assignments done, then sweet repose,  
Life's rhythm plays on.

[^1]: Also on a side note passively existing next to a close friend is very nice.
[^2]: Gen Z or younger slang for "being solely in your zone and concentrated on a task".
