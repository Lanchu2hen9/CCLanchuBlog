# Task 1:

**Chosen Graphic Programming Language:** ComfyUI

# Task 4:

**Why you are interested in this GPL?**
Because I am an UX/UI, website and front-end designer. And um A.I. is slowly taking over those fields, so I might as well adapt before I die.

**How you might use this GPL in your own creative practice?**  
~To cram out work 1 day prior to its deadline. /j~ Mostly for mood-board development, if I want smth hyper specific to be generated. Or human faces to create UX personas.

## Strengths:

- Easy to customise, to share.
- Clear Visuals
- No prior experience with coding needed.

## Weaknesses:

- Inconsistent organisation of between workflows between collaborators
- The "net" of strings of the graphic programming interface might get a bit messy after a while.
- Lag if your computer doesn't meet the requirements of the interface.

## Generated Images:

**The strengths & weaknesses of this GPL vs other GPLs**
ComfyUI is very A.I. centred and requires users to have some semblance of how A.I. works. Generates only image/3D assets, there's not really much specific "art installation"/more experiement/creative things you can do with ComfyUI.

## Strengths & Weaknesses of GPLs:

### Strengths:

- More easy for someone who may not be the most "mathematically-inclined" to learn out coding/programming logic works. (I.E. it might be better for those who learn better visually.)
- If smth fucks up you can see specifically where in the "code" the error occurred.
- Less of steep of a learning curve.
- Easier to debug and to collaborate with other people.

### Weaknesses:

- Le noodle wires of the graphic programming might get a bit disorganised after a while.
- Some GPL have very specific niche multimedia areas, i.e. the Blender nodes for 3D modelling, Pure Data more for sound stuff.
  - To those who are not the most interest in the specific niche fields in which these GPL appeal to, it might be more difficult for them to get into learning said GPL.
  - I.E. Let's say a graphic designer who has a scripting background, wants to learn the "blender nodes" parts of Blender, they might look at the termology "UV map" and go like "wtf is this?!"
- The learning curve is easy to learn but plateaus after a while.

## Strengths & Weaknesses of Text-based coding:

### Strengths:

- Very open source, I feel like with the event of "Google" and A.I. and the fact that the coding community is very open source, it is very easy to pick up coding/a new language.
- Portability ~ code can run on literally any device.
- Version Control

### Weaknesses:

- Termology might be a pain in the arsecheeks for those first approaching text based code. Like bro a "Nullish coalescing operator" who dat?
- Seeing 999+ console errors can be very fustrating, and having no idea what the console errors mean.

  - Its like I know I fucked up and the code doesn't like me, but where did I fuck up? [^1]

- **Syntax Errors**, if you can't spell to save your own life or have dyslexia you are done.

[^1]: Me being introduced to programming in Unity via C#: "WHY IS THERE 999+ console errors, and why is the Console screaming at me?!"
