# Task 1:

**Chosen Graphic Programming Language:** ComfyUI

# Task 4:

**Why you are interested in this GPL?**
Because I am an UX/UI, website and front-end designer. And um A.I. is slowly taking over those fields, so I might as well adapt before I die.

**How you might use this GPL in your own creative practice?**  
~To cram out work 1 day prior to its deadline. /j~ Mostly for mood-board development, if I want smth hyper specific to be generated. Or human faces to create UX personas.

**The strengths & weaknesses of this GPL vs other GPLs**

**The strengths & weaknesses of GPLs in general, vs text based scripting languages.**
