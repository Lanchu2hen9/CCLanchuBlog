Ooh last "offical" blog of this class, how fancy. Keep in mind I have not attended this class and I've also asked A.I. about discussion points and its like: "Hmm yes the slides are about the flow/control of information>'

**Whether or not inclusion should be considered a core, structural pillar of creative coding.**

Yes fundamentally yes inclusive should be considered a core, structural pillar of **coding** in general and not just creative coding. Because as a practicality first woman, I believe creativity comes second when people have the "programming" skillset to "fuck around and find out" when it comes to technology. For example, I had a German teacher who once taught me in an german class, that when you first start to learn an language you make sounds, and later that turns into fully-structured coherent sentences and phrases. I believe something similiar happens with creativity, you have the programming tools and then you start smashing said programming tools together until something makes sense.

In terms of digital infrastructure & digital technology-generating capacity, there are communities like the elderly, disabled, marginalised and remote/economically Disadvantaged. And by making creative coding more inclusive to them it allows them to have a form of expression that not only allows their voice heard, and also gives them more tools to fight for their rights.

**Intrinsic / extrinsic motivations for learning & computer science gatekeeping.**
The more people regardless of their background know more about Creative Coding, the more interest in generated for creative coding. And in terms of computer science gatekeeping, there is a lot of socio-economical barriers, such as improper funding to school that prevents students from learning higher-level computer science. Generally speaking I think that more inclusivity in creativity coding would make like that "technical jargon" side of things be more appealing to those who "fear" more the technical side of coding.

Digital literacy & legislation => more legislation allowing students from dfferent background to study creative coding allows for more inclusivity.

Vectoralist / Techno-Feudalist Forms of Oppression => inherently non-inclusive structure => more inclusion => less power and control of digital infrastructure, and information in the hands of the few.

**Interoperability;** more interoperability allows for the distribution of information through the masses Vectoralist / Techno-Feudalist Forms would be a more authoritarian form/ system and by being more inclusive this gives those who are oppressed more opportunitity to spread information b/w devices. For example, let's say in a dictorship, a person has a radio and they want to plug that radio into a laptop, but they don't have the nesscary dongles or connectors. And they're a creative coder, their coding skills maybe allows them to code smth to connect said radio to their laptop.
