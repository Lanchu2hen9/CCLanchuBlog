Ooh last "offical" blog of this class, how fancy. Keep in mind I have not attended this class and I've also asked A.I. about discussion points and its like: "Hmm yes the slides are about the flow/control of information>'

**Whether or not inclusion should be considered a core, structural pillar of creative coding.**

Yes fundamentally yes inclusive should be considered a core, structural pillar of **coding** in general and not just creative coding. Because as a practicality first woman, I believe creativity comes second when people have the "programming" skillset to "fuck around and find out" when it comes to technology. For example, I had a German teacher who once taught me in an german class, that when you first start to learn an language you make sounds, and later that turns into fully-structured coherent sentences and phrases. I believe something similiar happens with creativity, you have the programming tools and then you start smashing said programming tools together until something makes sense.

In terms of digital infrastructure & digital technology-generating capacity, there are communities like the elderly, disabled, marginalised and remote/economically Disadvantaged. And by making creative coding more inclusive to them it allows them to have a form of expression that not only allows their voice heard, and also gives them more tools to fight for their rights.

**Intrinsic / extrinsic motivations for learning & computer science gatekeeping.**
The more people regardless of their background know more about Creative Coding, the more interest in generated for creative coding. And in terms of computer science gatekeeping, there is a lot of socio-economical barriers, such as inproper funding to school that prevents students from learning higher-level computer science.
