# Task 1:

The artwork by Rafael Rozendaal that I will be yapping about in this blog post is ["Looking at Something .com"](https://www.lookingatsomething.com/).

## Visuals:

In spite, most artworks in the common aesthetic register of "cute" having the theme common of bright and overly saturated colours. I argue that the simplicity of _Looking at Something .com's_ visuals is what makes it so visually appealingâ€”arguably cute.

Visually speaking, _Looking at Something .com's_ sky starts off as a brightly saturated blue, then gradually desaturates into a lighter shade, darkens to indigo and navy blue, and finally fades to black. Throughout this gradient shift, rain falls increasingly heavily as the "sky" transitions from light blue to dark blue. Both the transition in the "sky gradient" and "amount of rain precipitation", is controlled by the user's mouse-y position in the window. This interaction has the same effect as a child playing with a toy snow globe. The user, much like a child, is engaging with a simulacrum of a real-world phenomenon.

If we take a more meta perspective, the fact that this artwork exists on the Internet commodifies and packages it into a neat little gift box for each user to experience.

## Sonically:

I really have nothing more to yap about the sounds section of _Looking at Something .com_, but the sounds of rain and birds chirping add to the effect of the simulacrum.

## Interactively:

Within the theme of aesthetic register of cute, cute things are often used to subvert power and control. Likewise I believe that, because of the fact that _Looking at Something .com_ is a web simulacrum, it is prone to the limitations of its medium. Such as lag and slow Internet connection. For example, Ngai states that "the cute thing [often] can mask...its own making" Jasper, A. (no date), this is similiar to how commercialised soft plush toys may have sweatshop and or unethical practices behind its creation. Shifting focus to the website, about "1.76 grams of CO2 [is released] per page view" Jardine, P & Thorn, B. (2024)[^1], in saying that, Rozendaal's _Looking at Something .com_ artwork may or may not release negliable amounts of CO2. The endearing, and cute nature of _Looking at Something .com_, masks the technical limits of lag spikes, glitches, and poor Internet connection in the inherant nature of Rozendaal's works.

In a less formal, ted-talk style, I also find it this artwork has a sense of artificiality, because it tries to simulate a natural phenomeon of rain. It feels "not natural" in a weird way.

# Task 2:

I haven't done that much for the waves background but here is the [p5 file](https://editor.p5js.org/Lanchu2hen9/sketches/xiz9X7J1b).  
Time code: roughly [2:55](https://youtu.be/nqvJDkKsYYI?si=yiRRF8kT2cO6xhkC&t=176)mins in.  
Going to work on the duck xyolophone part.  
[Duck xylophone, p5 file](https://editor.p5js.org/Lanchu2hen9/sketches/cuZN7X6dW). Still a WIP.

<iframe id="DuckPondD1" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Lanchu2hen9/full/cuZN7X6dW"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`DuckPondD1`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>

The 6 ducks are not there, but this is like a rough draft of the duck part.

- Classes are like cookie cutter, it makes new objects.
