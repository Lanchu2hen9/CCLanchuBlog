# Functions:

Putting the the "fun" in function. The notes are canvas. See [this.](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/151099/files/44446406?module_item_id=7215351)

Functions have inputs and outputs:

- Arguments are inputs
- Returns are outputs.
- Side effects are when functions change things outside their scope.

`function find_point (start, end, phase) {...}`

- function name (parameters) {stuff that the function executes.}
- Functions are essientally behaviours.
- Behaviours are called methods.
  - In `cassie.resize (width, height);`, `.resize(...);` is a method.
  - Methods are like little commands telling p5 what to do.
- If you are seeing an arrow you are seeing a function definition.
  - Sometimes `b => b.draw ()` in `bouncers.forEach (b => b.draw ())` are called anonymonous functions and or Lamda functions.c

# Objects

- An attributes always lives on an Object. They're like variables but less free-floating.
  - Its bit like a russian-nesting doll where you can nest attributes within variables and variables within Objects.
  - Attributes are like name-tags for specific data within variables. So for example:
    `const sqr = {x : 150, y : 150, s : 100}` , `square (sqr.x, sqr.y, sqr.s)`
  - You can refer to `x : 150` within const sqr in another function by saying `sqr.x`

# Images:

See [dis.](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/6isoheSb1)

# Vectors:

- Vectors are the line from the origin to that specific point that you chose.

- You can use velocities added to the object.
