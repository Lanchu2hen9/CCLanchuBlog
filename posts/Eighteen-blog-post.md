# Task 1:

For task one I'll be use Gemini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet version of Copilot and Ollama. Copilot/Claude 3.5 Sonnet is probably more code based, since its built into VScode but let's see where it goes. A.i.'s in <font color='green'>green</font>, me in black.

## Prompt 1:

Referring to this link: "https://cclanchublo6.deno.dev/Sixithteen-blog-post#uxui-community" and the content underneath UX/UI Community title, you can also refer to the webpage as a whole. (Here's the link to the whole page just in case you are confused: "https://cclanchublo6.deno.dev/Sixithteen-blog-post"). I am thinking of engaging with the UX/UI community of practice.

I want to create a professional-looking/modern boring flat design websites, like those basic ass website designs that you find on website like: "https://dribbble.com/search/websites" and "https://www.behance.net/search/projects/website?tracking_source=typeahead_search_direct" but when the user interacts either with the search bar by typing things into it or clicking on buttons it does a playful action a bit like, how when you type "do a barrel roll" into Google the loaded search page does a barrel roll.

My central goal/"response" that I want to pique to sort of "poke fun" at how in UX/UI research/design users are condensed into "analytical points" and how one of the "main goals" of UX/web development is to get users to search/visit the website more often. In less eloquent terms to "maximise demn websites visits".

I would like ideas on how I could engage the UX/UI Community in interesting ways, refer to the website link, and give me some tech stacks as well as deployment options. And as well as feasibility of creating something like this idea in 3-4 weeks, given that I am a human and I have to do things like eat, breath, make breakfast and travel to University.

## Ollama:

<font color='green'>**Tech Stacks:**

For building a modern, flat-design website with interactive elements,
consider the following tech stacks:

1. Frontend:
   - HTML5
   - CSS3 (with preprocessor like Sass or Less)
   - JavaScript (with libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js)
   - A framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling and layout
2. Backend (for server-side rendering or API interactions):
   - Node.js with Express.js
   - Django or Flask for Python-based solutions
3. Database:
   - MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data and design submissions
4. Deployment options:
   - GitHub Pages or Netlify for static website hosting
   - Vercel or AWS Amplify for serverless deployment

**Feasibility of creating something like this in 3-4 days:**

As a human with a busy schedule, it's challenging to complete complex
projects within such a short timeframe. However, you can focus on building
a minimum viable product (MVP) that showcases your idea and gathers
feedback from the community.

To achieve this:

1. **Simplify your design concept:** Focus on the core features and
   interactions you want to implement.
2. **Use pre-built components:** Utilize popular front-end libraries or
   frameworks to speed up development.
3. **Prioritize your tasks:** Focus on essential features, like
   interactive elements and search functionality, and delay less critical
   aspects (e.g., database integration).
4. **Join online communities:** Collaborate with other developers,
   designers, or UX enthusiasts through online forums, Discord channels, or
   social media groups to gather feedback, advice, and resources.

**Time estimation:**

Assuming you have a basic understanding of the tech stacks and design
principles, here's a rough estimate of the time required for each stage:

1. Research and planning: 2-3 days
2. Building the MVP: 2-3 days (depending on your familiarity with the tech
   stack)
3. Testing, iteration, and polishing: 2-4 days

Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the actual time required
will depend on your pace, experience, and the scope of your project.

Remember to take breaks, eat well, breathe fresh air, and get some rest!
You got this

**Ideas for engaging with the UX/UI Community:**

1. **Design Challenges:** Host or participate in design challenges that
   encourage users to create innovative website designs. You could provide a
   theme, constraints, and a twist (like the "maximize website visits" goal
   you mentioned) to add an extra layer of fun.
2. **Community-driven Website:** Create a website that showcases
   user-submitted designs, with features like voting, commenting, or sharing.
   This will encourage community participation and help you gather feedback
   on your design concepts.
3. **Game-like Interactions:** Incorporate interactive elements, such as
   the barrel roll effect, to make users engage with your websites in a more
   playful way. You could also explore using gamification techniques, like
   rewards or leaderboards, to incentivize users to visit and share your
   designs.
4. **UX/UI Research Interviews:** Conduct interviews with UX/UI
   researchers and designers to gather insights on their thoughts on user
   behavior, design principles, and the goals of UX/web development. Share
   these findings in a blog post or presentation, and engage with the
   community through discussion threads.
5. **Design sprints and hackathons:** Organize design sprints or
   hackathons where participants come together to create innovative website
   designs within a short timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours). This will allow you
   to gather feedback, build relationships, and showcase your work in a
   fast-paced environment.

**Tech Stacks:**

For building a modern, flat-design website with interactive elements,
consider the following tech stacks:

1. Frontend:
   - HTML5
   - CSS3 (with preprocessor like Sass or Less)
   - JavaScript (with libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js)
   - A framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling and layout
2. Backend (for server-side rendering or API interactions):

3. Database:
   - MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data and design submissions
4. Deployment options:
   - GitHub Pages or Netlify for static website hosting
   - Vercel or AWS Amplify for serverless deployment

**Feasibility of creating something like this in 3-4 weeks:**

Given your busy schedule, it's essential to prioritize your tasks and
focus on the most critical aspects of your project. Here's a rough outline
to help you achieve your goal:

1. **Week 1: Research and planning**
   _ Spend 2-3 days researching design trends, interactive elements, and user
   behavior.
   _ Plan your website's structure, features, and interactions. \* Create a wireframe or mockup of your design concept.
2. **Week 2: Frontend development**
   _ Focus on building the frontend of your website using HTML5, CSS3, and
   JavaScript.
   _ Implement interactive elements, such as the barrel roll effect. \* Use a framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling and layout.
3. **Week 3: Backend development (optional) and deployment**
   _ If you plan to add server-side rendering or API interactions, focus on
   building those components.
   _ Deploy your website using GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or AWS Amplify.
4. **Week 4: Testing, iteration, and polishing**
   _ Test your website for usability, accessibility, and performance.
   _ Gather feedback from the community through design challenges, blog
   posts, or social media discussions. \* Iterate on your design concept based on user feedback and refine your
   implementation.

**Time estimation:**

Assuming you have a basic understanding of the tech stacks and design
principles, here's a rough estimate of the time required for each stage:

1. Research and planning: 4-6 days
2. Frontend development: 8-12 days
3. Backend development (optional): 2-4 days
4. Deployment and testing: 2-4 days

Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the actual time required
will depend on your pace, experience, and the scope of your project.

**Tips for managing your time effectively:**

1. **Prioritize:** Focus on the most critical aspects of your project
   first.
2. **Break tasks into smaller chunks:** Divide larger tasks into
   manageable pieces to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
3. **Use a schedule:** Plan out your day, week, or month, and stick to it
   as much as possible.
4. **Take breaks:** Make time for rest, exercise, and relaxation to
   maintain your productivity and well-being.

Remember to be flexible and adapt to changes in your project's scope or
timeline. Good luck with your project! </font>

I like the idea of "voting, commenting, or sharing" in point 2 underneath the "Ideas for engaging with the UX/UI Community:" bit. But hold your horses, I not the most involved in the UX/UI Community, like I have platforms that I can go to, but I don't talk on those places that much. I also have classmates in my university that I can possibly get into contact with. But I kind of don't want to. I also would like to keep the idea of "basic ass website design" but I am lazy, and I don't want to code and have to design this website at the same time.

<font color='green'> I understand your concerns and laziness (who doesn't love a good excuse
for not wanting to code, right?). Let's break down the idea and see if we
can simplify it to make it more manageable.

**Simplifying the "Community-driven Website" concept:**

Instead of building an entire website from scratch, you could focus on
creating a simple landing page or a microsite that showcases your design
concepts. This way, you can still engage with the UX/UI community without
having to invest too much time and effort into building a full-fledged
website.

Here are some alternatives:

1. **Design a minimalistic brochure:** Create a digital brochure that
   highlights your design concept and features. You can use a tool like Canva
   or Adobe XD to create a basic design.
2. **Build a microsite using a CMS:** Use a Content Management System
   (CMS) like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace to create a simple website with
   minimal coding required. You can focus on designing the layout and content
   without worrying about the underlying code.
3. **Share your design process on social media:** Instead of building an
   entire website, share your design process on platforms like Dribbble,
   Behance, or Instagram. Share your sketches, wireframes, and prototypes to
   get feedback from the community.

**Engaging with classmates (or not):**

If you're not interested in reaching out to your classmates, that's okay
too! You can focus on sharing your work online and engaging with the UX/UI
community through platforms like:

1. **Dribbble:** Share your designs and participate in design challenges.
2. **Behance:** Showcase your portfolio and share your work with the
   community.
3. **Reddit (r/design or r/webdev):** Share your projects and get feedback
   from others.

**Keeping it "basic"**

To keep your website design simple, you can focus on using pre-designed
templates or frameworks that are easy to customize. Some popular options
include:

1. **Bootstrap:** A popular front-end framework for building responsive
   web applications.
2. **Material-UI:** A material design-based UI framework for building fast
   and efficient websites.
3. **Wix:** A website builder platform that offers a range of templates
   and drag-and-drop functionality.

These tools can help you create a basic yet visually appealing website
without requiring too much coding or design expertise.

**Lazy-friendly tech stacks:**

To reduce the amount of coding required, consider using lazy-friendly tech
stacks like:

1. **No-code website builders:** Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress.com offer
   drag-and-drop functionality and pre-built templates.
2. **Front-end frameworks with a low learning curve:** Bootstrap or
   Material-UI can help you build responsive web applications without
   requiring extensive coding knowledge.

What do you think? Is this more in line with your expectations? </font>

I'm in a coding course, so something like Wix, or using figma, or framer is out of the window. Tell me more about Bootstrap, I want to do smth that's more front-end. And maybe smth that's more involved in gamification, or the concept likes/comments and stuff.

<font color='green'>With a coding course under your belt, we can dive deeper into front-end
development and explore options that incorporate gamification elements.

**Bootstrap:**

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive web
applications. It provides a set of pre-designed CSS classes and HTML
templates to speed up development. With Bootstrap, you can create a
website that's not only visually appealing but also has a solid foundation
for responsive design.

Some key features of Bootstrap include:

1. **Responsive design:** Bootstrap comes with pre-built responsive
   layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
2. **CSS framework:** Provides a set of reusable CSS classes for styling
   elements like buttons, forms, and navigation bars.
3. **HTML templates:** Offers pre-designed HTML structures for common web
   pages like homepages, about pages, and contact pages.

**Gamification Elements:**

To incorporate gamification elements into your website, consider the
following:

1. **Leaderboards:** Create a leaderboard that tracks user engagement or
   performance. You can use JavaScript libraries like Chart.js or Highcharts
   to visualize the data.
2. **Badges and Achievements:** Design a system where users earn badges or
   achievements for completing specific tasks or achieving milestones.
3. **Points Systems:** Implement a points system where users can earn
   points for interacting with your website, such as commenting on designs or
   participating in discussions.

**Focusing on Front-end:**

To focus more on front-end development, you can explore the following
options:

1. **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building user
   interfaces. React is ideal for creating complex, interactive UI
   components.
2. **Vue.js:** Another popular JavaScript framework for
   building web applications. Vue.js offers a robust set of features and
   tools for creating efficient and scalable front-end code.

**Incorporating Comments and Likes:**

To create a system that allows users to comment on designs or share their
feedback, consider the following:

1. **Front-end comments API:** Use a library like Comment.js to create a
   simple commenting system.
2. **AJAX requests:** Make AJAX requests to fetch data from your
   server-side database to display user-generated content.

Some popular front-end frameworks that can help you achieve this include:

1. **React-CMUI:** A React-based UI framework for building commenting and
   voting systems.
2. **Vue-Comment:** A Vue.js-based commenting system that provides a
   robust set of features.

**Example Code:**

Here's an example of how you could create a simple commenting system using
React and the Comment.js library:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Comment from "comment";

const CommentSystem = () => {
  const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);

  const handleCommentSubmit = (newComment) => {
    setComments([...comments, newComment]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {comments.map((comment, index) => (
        <Comment key={index} content={comment.text} />
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={(e) => handleCommentSubmit(e.target.value)}>
        <input type="text" name="comment" placeholder="Write a comment..." />
        <button type="submit">Post Comment</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This code creates a simple commenting system that displays user-generated
content and allows users to submit new comments.

I hope this helps! Do you have any specific questions about Bootstrap or
front-end development?</font>

You know what's funny Ollama actually made a mistake, Comment.js should be in Javascript. This is why people you fact check the A.I.

Actual code that's correct, this is also A.I. generated:

```javascript
import Comment from "comment";

const CommentSystem = () => {
  const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);

  const handleCommentSubmit = (newComment) => {
    setComments([...comments, newComment]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {comments.map((comment, index) => (
        <Comment key={index} content={comment.text} />
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={(e) => handleCommentSubmit(e.target.value)}>
        <input type="text" name="comment" placeholder="Write a comment..." />
        <button type="submit">Post Comment</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};
```

You know how like for UX/UI design there's like Wix and things of those sorts that create website out of pre-made templates for you? Is there like a code-version equivalent of that?

<font color='green'>Yes, there are several code-based frameworks and tools that offer pre-made
templates or skeletons for building websites and web applications. Here
are a few examples:

1. **Bootstrap Templates:** Bootstrap offers a range of pre-built
   templates for various industries, such as e-commerce, blogs, and more.
   These templates provide a solid foundation for building responsive
   websites.
2. **Material-UI Templates:** Material-UI provides a set of pre-built
   templates for building modern web applications using their framework.
   These templates offer a great starting point for building complex UI
   components.
3. **React Boilerplates:** React Boilerplates is an open-source project
   that provides a set of pre-configured React projects with a range of
   boilerplate code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This helps
   developers get started with building React applications quickly.
4. **Vue.js Templates:** Vue.js also has a range of pre-built templates
   for various industries, such as e-commerce, blogs, and more. These
   templates provide a solid foundation for building responsive web
   applications.
5. **Next.js Templates:** Next.js is a popular framework for building
   server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. They offer a range of
   pre-built templates for various use cases, including blog, e-commerce, and
   more.

In terms of code-based frameworks that generate website templates, here
are a few examples:

1. **Gatsby:** Gatsby is an open-source framework for building fast,
   secure, and scalable websites using React. It comes with a range of
   pre-built templates for various industries.
2. **Storybook:** Storybook is a popular tool for building UI components
   in isolation. It also provides a range of pre-built templates for building
   entire applications.
3. **Create React App:** Create React App is a popular command-line
   interface (CLI) tool that generates a new React project with a range of
   boilerplate code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

These tools and frameworks provide a solid foundation for building
websites and web applications quickly, while also giving developers the
flexibility to customize their projects as needed.

Let me know if you'd like more information on any of these!</font>

### Ollama Conclusion:

I like the idea of using Bootstrap or some form of "code template" to set a basis for my code. I'm going to have to investigate things like "React.js, Vue.js, Comment.js, AJAX requests, React-CMUI and Vue-Comment.

## Gemini:

For control group purposes I will be starting with the Prompt 1. Pasted that exact prompt into Gemini it did not like that.

<font color='green'>I am sorry, I was unable to access the content of the webpage you provided. Therefore, I cannot provide information about the UX/UI community mentioned on that page.

However, if you still want an answer based on the URL provided, you can upload the content you have access to, and I can try to answer based on that.</font>

Good to see that Gemini is less invasive than ChatGPT. I `ctrl c` and `crtl v` my whole ass webpage into Gemini. This is its response:

<font color='green'>Based on the provided content, here are some ideas on how you could engage the UX/UI Community with a playful website that subtly pokes fun at the "user as a data point" concept, along with tech stack and deployment suggestions, and a feasibility assessment:

Ideas for Engaging the UX/UI Community:

#### The "Insight Harvester" Website:

**Concept:** Create a seemingly standard, minimalist portfolio or agency website (think Dribbble/Behance flat design). The homepage could have a prominent search bar and a few basic navigation links ("About," "Services," "Contact").

##### Playful Interactions:

**Search Bar:** When a user types common UX/UI terms (e.g., "user flow," "usability," "conversion rate," "A/B testing"), instead of showing search results, the website could display humorous, slightly absurd animations or text snippets related to the term. For example, typing "user flow" might show a chaotic spaghetti diagram, or "conversion rate" could trigger a little counter rapidly increasing to an unrealistic number.

**Buttons:** Clicking on seemingly standard buttons could trigger unexpected, playful animations. For instance, the "Contact" button might briefly turn into a "Data Collection Initiated" button with a loading spinner that never finishes, or the "About" section could briefly flash with the text "Analyzing User Intent..." in a robotic font.
Subtle Data Collection Visuals: You could have very subtle, almost hidden visual cues that appear upon interaction, mimicking data collection. This could be a brief flash of a heatmap overlay, tiny "tracking" icons that briefly appear near the cursor, or a counter in the footer that increments with each interaction with a tongue-in-cheek label like "Insights Gathered."

**Underlying Message:** The contrast between the professional, data-driven aesthetic and the absurd interactions highlights the reductionist view of users as mere data points to be analyzed and optimized. The humor comes from exaggerating common UX/UI jargon and practices.
The "Optimize Me" Portfolio:

**Concept:** Your personal portfolio website designed in a very generic, flat style. The focus is on showcasing your "skills" and "projects" in a predictable manner.

##### Playful Interactions:

**Skill Bars:** Instead of static skill bars, hovering over them could cause them to comically overshoot or undershoot, accompanied by labels like "User Engagement (Estimated)," "Conversion Optimization (Likely)," or "Data-Driven Design (Hypothetically)."

**Project Thumbnails:** Clicking on project thumbnails could lead to a modal with a very dry, analytical description of the "user problem" and "solution," followed by a completely unrelated, silly animation or image.

**Call to Action (CTA):** The main CTA (e.g., "View My Work," "Hire Me") could have playful text changes on hover, such as "Generate Lead," "Acquire User," "Monetize Interaction."
Underlying Message: This approach satirizes the often formulaic and metrics-obsessed nature of online portfolios and the pressure to present oneself as a purely data-driven entity.

##### Tech Stack:

##### Front-end:

**HTML:** For the basic structure and semantic markup.
**CSS:** For the flat, minimalist styling. You could use vanilla CSS or a utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS for rapid development.

**JavaScript:** For handling the interactive elements and playful animations. You can use vanilla JavaScript or a lightweight library like GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for more sophisticated and performant animations.

**Optional:**
A Simple Static Site Generator (SSG): Tools like Hugo or Jekyll can help organize your website content, although for a relatively small project like this, they might add unnecessary complexity within your timeframe.
Deployment Options:

**Netlify:** Offers free hosting for static websites with easy Git integration and continuous deployment.
**Vercel:** Similar to Netlify, providing free static hosting and a streamlined deployment process.
**GitHub Pages:** Free hosting directly from your GitHub repository.
**Render:** Another platform offering free static site hosting.
Feasibility in 3-4 Weeks:

Creating a basic flat design website with playful interactions as described is feasible within 3-4 weeks, considering your other commitments, but it will require focused effort. Here's a breakdown:

##### Week 1: Planning and Basic Structure:

Solidify your chosen concept and plan the specific playful interactions.
Set up your development environment.
Create the basic HTML structure and initial CSS for the flat design.

##### Week 2: Implementing Interactions:

Focus on implementing the JavaScript logic for the search bar and button interactions.
Start creating the animations (either with CSS transitions/animations or a JS library).

##### Week 3: Refining and Adding Content:

Refine the animations and ensure they are smooth and playful.
Add any necessary content (minimal text for a portfolio/agency style).
Test the website thoroughly on different browsers.

##### Week 4 (Buffer/Video Creation):

Address any bugs or polish the design.
Start planning and recording your 3-5 minute video explaining your plan, what happened, and your reflections.
Tips for Staying on Track:

**Keep it Simple:** Focus on a few key playful interactions rather than trying to implement too many complex features.

**Prioritize:** Get the core functionality and the intended humor working first.
Reuse Components: Design reusable CSS styles and JavaScript functions to speed up development.
Don't Overthink the Design: The "boring flat design" aesthetic should be relatively quick to implement.

**Time Management:** Allocate specific blocks of time for working on the project each day or week.

By focusing on a clear concept, utilizing a straightforward tech stack, and managing your time effectively, you should be able to create an engaging and humorous website that effectively responds to the UX/UI community within your timeframe. Remember to document your process and clearly articulate your intentions in your video.</font>

I like the playful interactions bit. I might incorporate theses ideas into AT3.

Out of these options: React.js, Vue.js, Bootstrap Templates, Material-UI Templates, React Boilerplates, Vue.js Templates, Next.js Templates, Gatsby, Storybook and Create React App. Give me a brief summary of what each of these options do in the scope of front-end coding. And what kind of tool they are, and what they can be used for. For context, when I mean tool, I mean like how in the kitchen different knifes is used for cutting different kinds of food. And how a spatula is used to flip food.

<font color='green'>
Okay, let's break down those front-end options using your kitchen analogy:

##### React.js:

**Summary:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It focuses on creating dynamic and interactive single-page applications (SPAs). Think of it as a versatile set of high-quality chef's knives – you can use them to precisely cut and prepare all the individual ingredients (UI components) of your web application.

**Tool Type:** JavaScript Library.
**Used For:** Building complex, interactive front-end applications, SPAs, component-based UIs.
Vue.js:

**Summary:** Another progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It's often praised for its ease of learning and integration. Imagine it as a reliable and user-friendly multi-tool in your kitchen – it can handle many common UI tasks efficiently and is often a great starting point for various web projects.

**Tool Type:** JavaScript Framework.
**Used For:** Building interactive web interfaces, SPAs, and integrating dynamic features into existing HTML.

##### Bootstrap Templates:

**Summary:** Pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates built on the Bootstrap framework. They provide ready-made layouts and styles to quickly create responsive websites. Think of these as pre-made meal kits – they give you all the necessary ingredients (HTML structure, styling) and instructions to quickly assemble a basic website.

**Tool Type:** CSS Framework & Template Collection.
**Used For:** Rapidly prototyping and building basic to moderately complex responsive websites with a consistent look and feel.

##### Material-UI Templates:

**Summary:** Similar to Bootstrap templates, but specifically designed based on Google's Material Design guidelines. They offer pre-built UI components and layouts adhering to this design system. Consider them as specialized ingredient kits focused on a specific cuisine (Material Design) – they provide the building blocks to create websites and applications with a modern, Android-like aesthetic.

**Tool Type:** UI Component Library & Template Collection.
**Used For:** Building web applications with a consistent and modern Material Design look and feel, often used with React.

##### React Boilerplates:

**Summary:** Pre-configured React project setups that include essential tools and configurations (like build scripts, routing, state management). They aim to save you the initial setup time for a React project. Think of them as a well-organized pantry with all your basic cooking equipment and ingredients already in place, ready for you to start cooking (coding) your specific application.

**Tool Type:** Project Setup/Starter Kit.
**Used For:** Quickly starting new React projects with common configurations already handled.
Vue.js Templates:

**Summary:** Similar to React boilerplates, these are pre-structured Vue.js projects with common configurations and often include routing, state management, and build tools. They provide a head start for developing Vue.js applications. Imagine them as a pre-laid-out workstation in your kitchen, with your essential tools and ingredients for Vue.js development already within reach.

**Tool Type:** Project Setup/Starter Kit.
**Used For:** Quickly initiating new Vue.js projects with established best practices and configurations.

##### Next.js Templates:

**Summary:** Templates built on Next.js, a React framework for server-rendered React applications and static site generation. They often include features like routing, server-side rendering setup, and deployment configurations. Think of them as a specialized oven designed for a specific type of baking (server-rendered React) – it provides the environment and tools optimized for this approach.

**Tool Type:** React Framework & Template Collection.

**Used For:** Building SEO-friendly, performant React applications with server-side rendering or static site generation.

###### Gatsby:

**Summary:** A React-based static site generator. It allows you to build fast, secure websites that are pre-rendered to static HTML files. Imagine it as a high-tech food dehydrator – it takes your content and transforms it into lightweight, easily digestible (fast-loading) static files ready to be served.

**Tool Type:** Static Site Generator (React-based).
**Used For:** Building static websites like blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites with a focus on performance and SEO.

##### Storybook:

**Summary:** A development environment for UI components. It allows you to develop and test UI components in isolation, making it easier to manage and visualize them. Think of it as a dedicated tasting station for your UI components – you can inspect each individual component, see how it behaves in different states, and ensure it's perfect before integrating it into your main application.

**Tool Type:** UI Component Development Tool.
**Used For:** Developing, testing, and documenting reusable UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and other frameworks.

##### Create React App (CRA):

**Summary:** An officially supported command-line tool for quickly setting up a new React project with a basic development environment. Consider it your basic kitchen starter kit – it provides the essential tools and configurations to get a React project up and running quickly without worrying about the underlying build process.

## New Prompt:

Gemini so for this assignment that I am current yapping to you about, we have to have a community of practise, and build/code smth for that community. In the previous prompt the community of practise was the "UX/UI community". Given that we have to have some sort of interaction/reponse from the community. Like create smth for the community to interact with. I like can track down the community platform link for "UX Rescue" and post the website link to that platform, but that community is more of UX research over prototyping/coding. And additionally currently the link that I have is dead, and I am a lurker in the community so... (I've also been told that i don't have to directly interact with the community, it can be indirect.)

Keeping to the same website idea, my second community is my "high school friends". Refer to the Repertoire, here "...", I want to somehow reinvent the instagram website/platform (desktop version.)

### Ideas that I like:

<font color='green'>

#### The "Yearbook" Remix:

**Concept:** A website that mimics the layout of a high school yearbook but with interactive and dynamic elements.

**Profile Pages:** Clicking on a friend's photo could "deconstruct" their yearbook entry into its individual components (photo, name, quote, clubs) and then playfully reassemble them in a different, often humorous, way.

**Signatures Page:** Instead of static signatures, this page could feature dynamically generated "signatures" that appear as if someone is actually scribbling on the screen when you hover over them.

#### The "Group Chat Visualizer":

**Concept:** A website that presents an abstract and visual representation of your group chats over time (if you have access to anonymized data or can manually input key themes/moments).

**Timeline:** A visual timeline of your group chat history. Hovering over different periods could trigger changes in the visual representation (e.g., more chaotic visuals during periods of intense activity).

**Keyword Exploration:** A "search" function for keywords that, instead of showing text results, dynamically alters the visual representation based on the frequency and context of that keyword.

#### Tech Stack and Feasibility:

**Front-end:** HTML, CSS (potentially with Tailwind for rapid styling), and JavaScript (vanilla or with a lightweight animation library like GSAP).

- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- Anime.js
- Popmotion
- Rough.js
- Tailwind CSS
  </font>

## Gemini Conclusion:

- I like the idea of _"deconstructing"_ a website into its fundamental elements.
- I would be interesting to get the data from my group chats and have the visuals change based on the data and or user interaction of the data.

## Project Concept: Instagram Desktop Reinvention

### Community of Practice:

- Primary: High school friend group
- Secondary: Users of Instagram's desktop platform
- Interaction Type: Indirect (through design choices and features that reflect common usage patterns)

### Core Idea:

Create a reimagined Instagram desktop interface that specifically addresses how high school friend groups actually use the platform, with playful interactions that poke fun at typical social media behaviors.

### Features to Consider:

1. **Group Chat Visualization:**

```javascript
// Example concept for chat visualization
const chatVisualizer = {
  messages: [],
  renderChat: () => {
    // Transform chat data into interactive visualization
    // Add playful animations for typical friend group behaviors
    // (inside jokes, meme sharing, etc.)
  },
};
```

2. **Memory Timeline:**

```javascript
// Interactive timeline component
const timelineFeature = {
  memories: [],
  displayMemory: (event) => {
    // Show shared photos/posts in an unexpected way
    // Add "yearbook-style" interactions
  },
};
```

### Tech Stack Suggestion:

- Frontend: React.js with Framer Motion for animations
- Styling: TailwindCSS for rapid prototyping
- Animation: GSAP for complex interactions
  </font>

What do you mean by "Interaction Type: Indirect (through design choices and features that reflect common usage patterns)"

<font color='green'>
Let me explain "Indirect Interaction" in the context of your project:

Indirect Interaction Examples
Design Reflection of Community Behaviors

Designing features based on how your high school friends actually use Instagram
Example: If your friends often share memes in DMs, create an exaggerated animation when memes are shared
Usage Pattern Integration

Building features that respond to common behaviors without requiring direct community feedback
Example: If friends typically react with specific emojis, make those reactions trigger special effects
Here's a concrete example of how this might look in code:

```js
// Example of indirect interaction through design
const communityPatterns = {
  // Based on observed friend group behavior
  commonReactions: ["😂", "💀", "🤡"],

  // Special animation triggers for common patterns
  handleReaction(emoji) {
    if (this.commonReactions.includes(emoji)) {
      // Trigger exaggerated animation specific to friend group's favorite reactions
      playExaggeratedAnimation(emoji);
    }
  },

  // Feature reflecting how friends actually use DMs
  handleMemeShare() {
    // Add playful "meme overload" effect when friends spam memes
    if (memesSentInLastMinute > 5) {
      triggerMemeOverloadAnimation();
    }
  },
};
```

This approach means you don't need direct community participation during development - instead, you're building features that reflect and respond to their existing behaviors and patterns. It's like creating an "inside joke" in code form, where the interaction comes from how well the design understands and plays with the community's natural behaviors.

#### Claude 3.5 Sonnet:

Good job A.I. I can actually not interact with ppl. This key point => <font color='green'>"friend group's behavior inspires the interactions, the actual triggers come from any user interacting with your reimagined interface"</font>

# Task 2:

Make a gif. Btw I'm asking A.I. to explain stuff to me. I'll list the A.I. explainations in <font color='green'> green.</font>

> "you can use AI to help you with this task"

Already ahead of you buddy, A.I. was helping to code since I was a baby fetus coder.

## Copilot Prompt Setup:

Referring to the concepts in the p5.js library see "https://p5js.org/reference/", and basic Javascript concepts, such as global local, variables and basically any other concept that I have tackled within "#file:JavascriptConceptReview.md ". Be my helpful code tutor/teacher/mentor that is eager to explain coding concepts to me. Use analogies to explain coding concepts to me a bit like how I have explained concepts in the JavascriptConceptReview.md file. Feel free to add personality to your explainations as a tutor/teacher/mentor based of the JavascriptConceptReview.md file. Await for my prompts/questions to generate/answer questions.

## Learning:

```js
void setup()
{
  size(400,400);
}

int numFrames = 100;

void draw()
{
  background(255);

  float t = 1.0*(frameCount-1)/numFrames;

  float r = 100;
  float x = width/2 + r*cos(TWO_PI*t);
  float y = height/2 + r*sin(TWO_PI*t);

  stroke(0);
  strokeWeight(9.0); // size of black dot

  point(x,y);

  if(frameCount<=numFrames)
  {
    saveFrame("fr###.gif");
  }
  if(frameCount==numFrames)
  {
    println("All frames have been saved");
  }
}
```

### Fancy ass new termologies:

**saveFrame("fr###.gif");** Saves each from of the gif/animation. The ### is like a _placeholder_ for each frame.  
**println("Hello World"); & print("Hellow World");** are basically the same thing as `console.log("Hello World");`

Expect for the fact that `println("Hello World");` does this in the console:

![println(); message in the console](<println();.png>)

And `print("Hello World");` does this:

![print(); message in the console](<print();.png>)

On a side note Java is not very forgiving in terms of syntax, very fun Java. I like your son better.

![Java being a dick.](JavaDaddy.png)

```java
  float t = 1.0*(frameCount-1)/numFrames;
  // time relationship, some fancy ass maths that basically
  // means proportion of the No. of frames display at a time per total
  // amount of frames.

  float r = 100;
  // r determines how far the circle is from the centre of the canvas.

  float x = width/2 + r*cos(TWO_PI*t);
  // t is like the standard "x" value on a standard y = a*cos(2π
```

## Final Code:

```Java
 void setup()
{
  size(400,400);
  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100);
}

int numFrames = 150;
int NoCircles = 50;


void draw()
{
  background(139, 25, 100);

   float t = 1.0*(frameCount-1)/numFrames;
  // time relationship, some fancy ass maths that basically
  // means proportion of the No. of frames display at a time per total
  // amount of frames.

  // For each circle that is created do the following:
  for (int i = 0; i < NoCircles; i++) {
    float r = 8 + i * 8;
    // r determines how far the circle is from the centre of the canvas.

    float x = width / 2 + r*cos(TWO_PI*t + i*PI/4);
    float y = height / 2 + r * sin(TWO_PI * t + i * PI/4);

    float w = 0.2 * x + 10 * sin(TWO_PI * t * (i + 1));
    float h = 60 + 10 * cos(TWO_PI * t * (i + 1));

    fill((frameCount * 10000 + i * 250) % 90, 100, 100);
    noStroke();

    ellipse(x, y, w, h);
  // Squishy circle that changes colour, duplicate circle.

  }

  if(frameCount<=numFrames)
  {
    saveFrame("fr###.gif");
  }
  if(frameCount==numFrames)
  {
    println("All frames have been saved");
  }
}
```
